      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Telegeodynamics''' is an electromechanical earth-resonance concept for underground seismic exploration proposed by [[Nikola Tesla]].&lt;ref&gt;Telegeodynamics was later incorporated into his concepts of [[robotics]]&lt;/ref&gt;  

==Description==
He designed this system for use in prospecting and discerning the location of underground mineral structures through the transmission of mechanical energy through the subsurface.  Data from reflected and refracted signals can be analyzed to deduce the location and characteristics of underground formations.  Additional non-mechanical responses to the initial [[Electrotelluric|electrotelluric]] impulses may also be detected. 

The electromechanical oscillator was originally designed as a source of [[isochronous frequency|isochronous]] (that is to say, [[frequency stable]]), [[alternating current|alternating electric current]] used with both [[transceiver|wireless transmitting and receiving apparatus]]. In [[dynamical system |dynamical system theory]] an [[oscillator]] is called ''isochronous'' if the frequency is independent of its amplitude. A  [[electromechanical]] device which runs at the same rate regardless of changes in its [[prime mover|drive force]], so it keeps correct [[frequency]] ([[hertz|hz]]).
